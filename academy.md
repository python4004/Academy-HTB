we need to set
``` 
1-app_key "dBLUaMuZz7Iq06XtL/Xnz/90Ejq+DEEynggqubHWFj0="
2-lhost
3-rhost 
4-vhost (virtual host) for subdomain  
5-local machine port 
```
#### 2- user access 
In fact, it was not difficult to obtain the powers of the user.
I just reviewed the env file and found file with data base  and the `cry0l1t3` password.
Just need some time to search.

i upgraded to tty shell `python3 -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/bash")'` or to upgrade to full tty shell use this commands
```
   /usr/bin/script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null
    Ctrl-Z
    stty raw -echo
    fg
    Ctrl-Z
```
i found that `adm` group,
 To be honest, I did not know at first what it was, but I searched for it and knew the difference between it and the` admin `group

by adm previlige i could check process happen in the server is checked all logs i had access on them,

so i checked `audit` logs 
its very big logs so i should find way to search logs easly 
``` cat audit.log.3 |grep "uid=1002" ```

this process for server user tried to  use `su` command this data after hexadecimal decode `mrb3n_Ac@d3my!`
I think it's clear it's to  mrb3n 
i could take `mrb3n` previlige
